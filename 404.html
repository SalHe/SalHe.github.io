    <!-- This 404.html is coded specially for Github Page. Vue is a SPA framework, so when we deploy our vue app to Github Page, we could only access the index.html. What it means? For example, when we are in development environment, we can access http://127.0.0.1:3000/blog which should be https://xxx.github.io/blog. Actually, Github Page think the `blog` doesn't exist so we get 404 page. To solve this problem, we make a specific 404.html to convey the "wrong" link to Vue app. If our Vue app detect the "wrong" link, it push to router to make it work properly! -->
